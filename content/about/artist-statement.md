Having been raised largely infront of a computer screen, my first questions in art primarily had to do with the interface and physical connection. How did the organization of our lives affect the way we felt about them?

I asked this question because I was profoundly unhappy. I did not have a sense of agency or my place in the world. When I began to become curious about my own unhappiness, I realized that I had the agency to change certain things about the way I accessed community. I could, at the very least, foster agency with computers in order to affect the ways that they were used.

I became curious about my own preferences and continued to ask questions. A world unfolded, one of open-ended configurations where technology was not necessarily the center, although it could be. I found myself inside of a tradition of art, and art provided me the explanation that I needed to validate my inquiries.

At the time, I believed that everything worth making should carry some intention and purpose, so long as it were known to the artist. That way, one could be sure they were not tricking the audience; that they would not accidentally feel something when nothing were intended. I often wondered: "what is worth doing?" and found no satisfying answer to the question.

I thought the process of making art was a good way to understand something ethereal or abtract. I believed that successful artworks couldn't help but express these epiphanies, and the pursuit of creating connected with an overarching project of personal liberation. I valued work that was effectively didactic or persuasive. I worked very hard to set an agenda, and to make sure that my concerns were legible in the things that I made. I considered this a modality of respect towards the various audiences.

Now this has all fallen apart, and I could not be happier. I continue to struggle along, failing to find my way, leaving  artifacts as they come along.
